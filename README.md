Dotty is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify the management of dotfiles with seamless Git integration. It offers a comprehensive suite of features to help users organize, version control, and synchronize their system configuration files across multiple machines or environments.

Key features of Dotty include:

1. File Tracking: Users can specify which files on their local system to track. Dotty automatically pushes these tracked files to a Git repository, handling commits and version control.

2. Dotfile Installation: The tool can install dotfiles from a Git repository, with intelligent mapping between common files and system directories.

3. Multiple Profile Management: Dotty supports managing multiple "rices" or configuration profiles, allowing users to switch between different setups (e.g., light/dark themes) easily.

4. Text-based User Interface (TUI): A user-friendly interface for managing profiles, viewing active profiles, and tracking file changes.

5. Software Compatibility Check: Dotty can identify when a remote configuration includes settings for software not installed on the local system.

6. Screenshot Capture: Built-in functionality to take screenshots of the current desktop setup.

7. Online Sharing: Capability to post configurations online with links to dotfiles, facilitating easy sharing and collaboration.

8. Software Inventory: Generates a list of relevant installed software, useful for replicating environments across systems.

Overall, Dotty aims to streamline the process of managing and synchronizing system configurations, making it easier for users to maintain consistent environments across multiple machines or to switch between different setups effortlessly.
